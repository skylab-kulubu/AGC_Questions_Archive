The Kingdom of Algolab was a vast and powerful realm, feared by all other kingdoms due to its strong and brilliantly coordinated army.  
  
However, the wise king of Algolab had grown old and could no longer lead his army on expeditions. Realizing that his reign was coming to an end, the king decided to pass the throne to his son.  
  
However, wanting to ensure that his kingdom was in safe hands and that his magnificent army would be entrusted to a capable commander, the king wished to test his son's knowledge of governance. 
  
One day, while standing beside his great army, the king called for his son and said:  
+ "My son, as you know, the reason we were able to conquer the sacred lands of our great kingdom was because we had a wise commander and a brilliantly organized army.
  I have grown old, and I can no longer lead my army into battle. In order for you to take the throne, you must understand the system of our army."
  
*For example, I can divide 15-soldier units in three different ways, with the difference in the number of soldiers between any two consecutive units being a maximum of 1 :  7-8, 4-5-6, and 1-2-3-4-5.*  
  
*I want you to understand how I performed this division. By doing so, you will prove to me that you have the wisdom and leadership required to become a king!"*  
  
Can you write the program to help the prince understand the brilliantly organized system of the army and take the throne?
