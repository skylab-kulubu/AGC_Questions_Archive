# BETUL'S CONFUSION

## Statement

Betul is a first grade student and her teacher just started teaching her the numbers. Because her teacher is a little weird. He first taught everything about the letters, reading, alphabetical order and writing.  
And only after they learned all of it perfectly, he started to teach maths and numbers. That is why Betul is very confused when she sees the numbers for the first time and thinks that numbers are ordered wrong.  
  
Because according to alphabetical order, words starting with **b** come only after words started with **a**'s end. But in numbers after 1, 2 comes, then 3. She finds that very weird.  
  
And when her teacher gives her the homework with **Q** questions that ask to write numbers from 1 to **N** in an increasing order, she does it her way. She puts them in an order that is much like the alphabetical order, in which the numbers correspond to the letters.  
  
You are asked to find the ordered numbers that Betul wrote in her homework.

## Input Format

- First line contains an integer: `Q`  
- The next line contains `Q` space separated integers: `N1, N2, N3, ..., NQ`

## Output Format

- `Q` lines that have the numbers ordered in Betul's way and each number is separated by spaces.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 1000`  
- `1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000`
