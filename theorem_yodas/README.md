One day at the Jedi Temple, Master Yoda gave his padawans a difficult test:  
After the lightsaber lesson, the students were surprised when they opened their papers. Expecting grades in the 0-100 range, their papers contained only strange numbers: 4110, 5500, 6222.

One of the Padawans asked, confused:
+ “Master Yoda, what do these numbers mean?”

Yoda replied, speaking calmly:
+ “Notes, not just numbers. Each four number is the answer the sum of the squares of . Lagrange's theorem you must use, solve it you must. In these four numbers the power lies..

Another padawan asked:
+ “What should we do if there is more than one solution?”  
Yoda smiled, “Chosen the biggest solution should be. Rank them in order from largest to smallest. In the order the power lies. Hmm.”  

The Padawans set to work, each solving the number on their own sheet. Yoda was testing them not only with a mathematical test, but also their minds and strategies.

But how did Yoda do the grading, the conversion of grades 0-100 into these numbers? He used 
**[Lagrange's 4 Squares Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem)**. While the first group of padawans are busy calculating their own grades, can you help Yoda adjust the other group's grades? Can you write a program that calculates that? Yoda is counting on you. May the force be with you!
