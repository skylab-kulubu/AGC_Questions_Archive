SunnyReads Publishing, a cheerful little book house nestled in a cozy corner of the city, was excited to release its newest children's book. But oh no! The editors at SunnyReads had a tiny problem—they thought the book might be too tricky for young readers!
  
So, they called in the writer and gave some special guidelines to make the book more kid-friendly:
  
📖 A sentence should be short and sweet—no more than 4 words long!
  
🔠 Words should be simple—7 letters max per word!
  
📑 A paragraph should stay within 30 words—no super long ones!
  
🚫 And most importantly, no sneaky foreign-sounding words! 
  
That means no back-to-back vowels like "ae" or "oo." The words should feel pure and natural!
  
The writer, not wanting to count every single letter and word by hand (how exhausting!), found a brilliant solution—a magical error-checking machine! This handy device scanned a paragraph and counted the errors based on these rules:
     
❌ If a paragraph was too long—it beeped!
  
❌ If a word had too many letters—it buzzed!
  
❌ If two vowels were hugging each other—it blinked!
  
❌ If a sentence ran too long—it flashed red!
  
And at the end it screamed: 
### *"YOU HAVE MADE N ERRORS!"*
  
Now, with the machine’s help, even though writers had to suffer machine's whining, SunnyReads  made sure their books were just right for little readers—fun, easy, and full of imagination! 🌟📚✨
