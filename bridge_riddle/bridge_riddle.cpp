 * 2. Returning the torch with the faster of those two. (for a quick return)
 * 3. Sending the two slowest across. (They go at the slowest person's speed.This clears the two slowest person, making sure not to extend the time in future crossings)
 * 4. Returning the torch with the fastest person from the right side. (for a quick return)
 * This cycle repeats until only three or fewer peopleÂ remain.

/**
 * WHY Less than 3 PEOPLE?
 * Because when there is three people left no matter the times it always adds up tu the sum of each.
 * Example: 
 * 1 2 3 (1 and 2 goes (+2) 1 comes back (+1) 1 and 3 goes (+3))
 * And if there are two left the answer is the longer time taken
