# Captain MM: "GOOD MORNING, AGENT P."

It seems that Evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is at it again. He's apparently bought up 75% of the country's aluminum stock.  
I need you to go to his evil lair, find out what he's up to, and stop him.  
This mission might be harder than the others! As usual, you'll keep your identity hidden and pretend to be a mindless pet.  
Get to work, Agent P. We trust you.

**Agent P:** "Grrgrgrrrrrrggrgr gdhgrrgrhjh!"  
  
*The Captain's already figured that out... What about you?*

## Problem Statement

In this question, you will be given a string which includes the words Agent P said to Captain MM.  
And you are asked to find out the length of the longest **palindrome** in Agent P's speech which is the code that Captain MM will decipher.

> **Note:** A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

## Input Format

There is only one line of input that is the lowercase string `S` that includes Agent P's speech.

---

## Output Format

An integer `n` that is the length code that has to be cracked.

---

## Constraints

- `1 < |S| ≤ 8500`  
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 8500`  
- `S` consists of only lowercase letters and spaces.
