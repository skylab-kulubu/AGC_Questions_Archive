# Density I
In the Digital World, in a city called Algoland, a mathematician named Sirac was researching density patterns in number sequences. One day, Sirac discovered a mysterious sequence of numbers and wanted to analyze its most densely packed subsetâ€”a sequence of consecutive nonzero numbers.  
  
To achieve this, Sirac set the following rules:  
  
Identify the longest contiguous subsequence that consists only of nonzero numbers.  
If there are multiple sequences with the same length, choose the one with the largest sum.  
Can you help Sirac find the answer?  

## Input
+ First line is integer `n`.
+ Second line has `n` integers representing of the number sequence, i.e. `A_i`.

## Output
The density factor `f`.

## Constraits
+ `n` <= 10^6
+ `A_i` <= 2^63
