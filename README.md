# AGC Questions Archive

This repository contains a curated collection of problems and solutions from the **Algorithm Games Challenge (AGC)**, maintained by the **ALGOLAB team** of the **SKY LAB Club** at Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- Each folder represents a single AGC problem.
- The main solution language is **C++**.
- Some problems may also include optional solutions in other languages (e.g. Python, Go), depending on contributor preference.
- Each folder typically includes:
  - A brief `README.md` explaining the problem or the approach
  - One or more solution files

## üéØ Purpose

This archive is created to collect and preserve the problems from our **Algorithm Games Challenge (AGC)** competitions, and to contribute to the broader algorithm and competitive programming community.

Main goals:
- Archive original AGC problems prepared by the ALGOLAB team
- Support algorithm education and skill development
- Provide clean and reviewed solution references
- Share knowledge and resources with the wider community
